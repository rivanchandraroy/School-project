# 🏫 Air Quality Monitoring in School Environments

### Understanding Children’s Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter in Different Urban Settings

---

## 1. Background

Children spend a large portion of their day inside classrooms, making them **particularly vulnerable to air pollution**, especially from fine particulate matter.  
Their respiratory and cardiovascular systems are still developing, and prolonged exposure to **PM<sub>2.5</sub>**, **Black Carbon (BC)**, and **Ultrafine Particles (UFPs)** can **significantly affect their lung function, cognitive performance, and long-term health outcomes**.  

Understanding air quality in school environments is therefore **crucial for protecting children’s health** and improving **indoor air management strategies**.

## 2. Key Activities & Outcomes

### 🧪 Monitoring and Data Collection
- Deployed **low-cost air quality sensors** in **10 schools** representing **urban**, **suburban**, and **rural environments** to measure **PM₁**, **PM<sub>2.5</sub>**, and **PM₁₀** levels.
- Collected and analyzed **real-time data** on particulate matter and **Air Quality Index (AQI)**, followed by **data validation and quality control** of large datasets.

---

### 🩺 Exposure and Health Assessment
- Evaluated **students’ exposure levels** during classroom hours to estimate **potential respiratory and cognitive health risks**.

---

### 🌦️ Environmental and Seasonal Analysis
- Analyzed **spatiotemporal patterns** and **seasonal variations** to determine the **influence of environmental and microclimatic conditions** on air quality.

---

### 💻 Computational Analysis
- Used **Python** for data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization using:
  - `Pandas`
  - `NumPy`
  - `Matplotlib`

---

### 🧠 Insights and Policy Implications
- Generated insights to support **health-focused school ventilation strategies** and **policy recommendations** for **safer learning environments**.
