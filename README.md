# Air Quality Monitoring in School Environments

### Understanding Children’s Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter in Different Urban Settings

---

## 1. Background

Children spend a large portion of their day inside classrooms, making them **particularly vulnerable to air pollution**, especially from fine particulate matter.  
Their respiratory and cardiovascular systems are still developing, and prolonged exposure to **PM<sub>2.5</sub>**, **Black Carbon (BC)**, and **Ultrafine Particles (UFPs)** can **significantly affect their lung function, cognitive performance, and long-term health outcomes**.  

Understanding air quality in school environments is therefore **crucial for protecting children’s health** and improving **indoor air management strategies**.

## 2. Methodologies

### 2.1 Overview
**low-cost air quality sensors** was deployed in **10 schools** of **urban**, **suburban**, and **rural environments** to measure **PM₁**, **PM<sub>2.5</sub>**, and **PM₁₀** levels in different zones.
**real-time data** was collected to analyze particulate matter and **Air Quality Index (AQI)**, followed by **data validation and quality control** of large datasets.

Evaluated **students’ exposure levels** during classroom hours to estimate **potential respiratory and cognitive health risks**.

---

### 2.2 Environmental and Seasonal Analysis
Analyzed **spatiotemporal patterns** and **seasonal variations** to determine the **influence of environmental and microclimatic conditions** on air quality.

By these analysis various insights to support **health-focused school ventilation strategies** and **policy recommendations** for **safer learning environments** was generated.

---

### 2.4 Technology Stack
Used **Python** for data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization using:
  - `Pandas`
  - `NumPy`
  - `Matplotlib`

## 3. Results and Insights
### 3.1 Seasonal Variation

The PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration shows annual seasonality. It reduces in significant amount in wet season and increases in dry season.
