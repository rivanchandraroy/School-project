Children spend a large portion of their day inside classrooms, making them particularly vulnerable to air pollution, especially in fine particulate matter. Their respiratory and cardiovascular systems are still developing, and prolonged exposure to PM₂.₅, Black Carbon (BC), and Ultrafine Particles (UFPs) can significantly affect their lung function, cognitive performance, and long-term health outcomes. Understanding air quality in school environments is therefore crucial for protecting children’s health and improving indoor air management strategies.

Key Activities & Outcomes:
•	Deployed low-cost air quality sensors in 10 schools representing urban, suburban, and rural environments to measure PM₁, PM₂.₅, and PM₁₀ levels.

•	Collected and analyzed real-time data on particulate matter and Air Quality Index (AQI), followed by data validation and quality control of large datasets.

•	Evaluated students’ exposure levels during classroom hours to estimate potential respiratory and cognitive health risks.

•	Analyzed spatiotemporal patterns and seasonal variations to determine the influence of environmental and microclimatic conditions on air quality.

•	Used Python for data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

•	Generated insights to support health-focused school ventilation strategies and policy recommendations for safer learning environments.
